ENGINE'S STRUCTURE

Neptune is made up of several basic independant modules (graphics, AI,
sound...) called "Core Modules". 

Besides, Neptune is also composed of modules which combine core modules to implement
high level features. They are called "High Level Modules".

Finally, Neptune dispose of a set of interfaces which represent standard behaviors
useful througout the engine (from any core module to any high level one). We will
refer to the elements of the set as "Standard Interfaces". 


CLASS ADDITION

- Any class must inherit at most from one and only one other class. 
- A class can inherit from several standard interfaces.
- Any other engine-class dependency should be achieved through composition.


PLATFORM CREATION

Every new physical platform must have a Core, HighLevel and Project
directory. 

The signification of each directory name is as follows:
- Core: Contains core modules only. A High level module is made up of
core modules.

- High Level: Any module that relies on core modules.

- Project: Any file that permits the users to build the engine on 
their machine.
